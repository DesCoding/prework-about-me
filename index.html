      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> Welcome to my first webpage!  Keep reading to learn more about me. :-)  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p> St. Louis, Missouri  </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a woman of many hobbies...my favorites are traveling, practicing yoga, teaching yoga, and spending time with family/friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Throughout my career, I've sought opportunities to collaborate with IT teams to create dashboards and web-based solutions to office problems.  During these collaborations, I offered the user's perspective while my IT teammates (AKA the superheroes who made the magic happen) created tools/products which drastically improved our lives.  These experiences have inspired me to take the next steps to learn coding.  As a web developer, I plan to create products which will make life a little bit easier and add a little fun to the user's day. </p>
